                <p>
                    Elevate is a web portal application with three portals: an
                    Admin, Business, and Customer. Admins would have have access to
                    CRUD operations to manage their customers (business users).
                    Business users would also have some CRUD operations to manage
                    their direct customers and manage their subscription/benefit
                    packages. The customer would be able to view their current
                    subscriptions and the system would handle transactions
                    automatically. I took the role of lead UI/UX designer during our
                    design phase and later switched over to Front end developer
                    during the development stage.
